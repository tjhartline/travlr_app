# Travlr Getaways Full Stack Web Application

## Architecture

### Frontend Development:
In this project, we utilized Express for server-side rendering, HTML for markup, JavaScript for client-side scripting, and implemented a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular. Express provided a robust framework for server-side logic, while Angular facilitated the development of dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

### Backend Development:
The backend employed a NoSQL MongoDB database. MongoDB's flexibility in handling unstructured data and scalability made it a suitable choice for our application. The use of Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library streamlined interactions with the database.

## Functionality

### JSON vs JavaScript:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format, distinct from JavaScript. JSON serves as a standardized format for data exchange between the frontend and backend, promoting interoperability.

### Code Refactoring:
Throughout the development process, we refactored code to enhance functionality and efficiency. Reusable User Interface (UI) components played a pivotal role in this, allowing us to modularize code, simplify maintenance, and accelerate future development.

## Testing

### API Testing:
Testing involved various methods for API endpoints, ensuring they met functional requirements. Security testing was integrated to address vulnerabilities, and comprehensive endpoint testing was performed to validate data retrieval and manipulation.

## Reflection

### Professional Growth:
This course has significantly contributed to my professional growth. I've acquired skills in full-stack development, honed my ability to design robust architectures, and gained proficiency in using industry-standard tools. These skills have made me a more versatile and marketable candidate in the competitive field of web development.
